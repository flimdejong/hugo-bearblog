# About
Hey Roboticist!

I’m Flim. Welcome to a piece of the internet that is (soon) filled with precious information, high-res hardware pictures, and zero outside influence.

Currently, I’m a Master’s student in Robotics at the University of Twente, the Netherlands. I think robots are freakin' awesome. And if you're here, that means you probably think so too. So welcome, welcome to our corner of the web.

For personal reasons, I wanted to host a portfolio at first, and I do have a small [static website](https://flimdejong.com). But I wanted a place for blogging too, and giving more extensive information on the projects I worked at. This happens at [hub.kairobotics.com](https://hub.kairobotics.com). Then I thought: 

What if we create a place where all robotics enthusiasts can share what we find awesome? I want this space to be exactly that; a place where we can share our builds, drop tutorials and connect with each other.

I'm a firm believer that knowledge should be preserved, spread, and that all information should be free. The blog posts you make on here, are imported with markdown, so your data stays yours. Additionally, it is sent to fediverse, to share it with each platform that supports it.

## Why now?
The catalyst for launching now is the Fediverse.

This site runs on Hugo, with the HugoBear theme, and syncs to the main hub on hub.kairobotics.com. The forum/aggregator has native support for the Fediverse, a decentralized social network powered by the ActivityPub protocol (the same tech behind Mastodon and Lemmy).

This means whatever you share here, can be shared with the entire Fediverse! So now we are no longer a tiny dot in space, we are part of a global decentralized network of the Fediverse. And it's our place, no ads, no tracking, no nothing.

Join us. Let's build something that moves.
